The "Mafakaf" game is a fun and entertaining brain game that relies on deconstructing words and sentences in an innovative and engaging way! In the game, you work with words and sentences written in a "mafakaf" formatâ€”meaning they're broken up or combined using strange letters, Arabic stresses, and other unconventional styles.
